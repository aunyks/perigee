# Perigee

A headless realtime 3D engine built with a focus on the web.

For a (growing) list of examples, check out [perigee.aunyks.com](https://perigee.aunyks.com).

## Why this?

I want the core logic of my video games to fit in a single [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) binary so I'm free to handle input and graphics on any platform I want (desktop, web, refrigerator, console, mobile, etc) while the behavior stays the same.

This means that I can compile my game to a single, portable `.wasm` file and I (or other developers / modders) can bring the game to a new platform, change audio or visual assets, or use new input devices without needing to recompile the core game logic.

## Why not this?

If you're not interested in portability, or if you absolutely despise writing WebAssembly glue code between a Perigee binary and your runtime(s) of choice, then other engines may be better for you.
